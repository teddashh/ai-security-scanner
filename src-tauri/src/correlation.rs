//! Cross-engine correlation suggestions.
//!
//! Two engines scanning the same asset routinely report the same real-world
//! problem, and today each lands in the finding list as its own row. This
//! module proposes which rows describe one issue so the user can collapse them
//! deliberately.
//!
//! Everything here is a *suggestion*. Nothing in this module mutates a case.
//! Accepting a suggestion goes through the existing reversible, audited
//! `group_findings` path, so the user's decision — not this heuristic — is what
//! ever changes the record. Product spec §9.3 governs:
//!
//! - cross-engine findings are never destructively merged without a stable,
//!   reviewed equivalence rule;
//! - the basis, rule version, and uncertainty of an automatic correlation are
//!   visible;
//! - insufficient coordinates make a comparison unverifiable, and the product
//!   never guesses that two findings are the same;
//! - agreement between two engines is not called corroboration unless the
//!   retained evidence sources are demonstrably independent.
//!
//! The equivalence rule implemented here is deliberately the narrow one we can
//! defend: the *same published vulnerability identifier*, on the *same
//! package*, on the *same asset*. A CVE id is assigned to one specific flaw, so
//! two engines naming the same id about the same package are talking about the
//! same flaw. Configuration rules get no automatic correlation — `CKV_AWS_20`
//! and a KICS query UUID are separate rules with separate semantics, and
//! asserting they are one issue would be a guess.
