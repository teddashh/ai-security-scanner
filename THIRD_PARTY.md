# Third-party inventory for ai-security-scanner

Status: v0.1.0 source inventory; generated release evidence is artifact-specific

Last updated: 2026-08-26

Normative status: this is an artifact/license inventory, not a product specification. The [canonical product specification](docs/product-spec.md) controls user-visible behavior and release acceptance. A license, provenance, or admission problem may withhold the affected artifact or engine; it does not block the installed application, unaffected engines, saved reports, or an independently qualified platform.

`ai-security-scanner` orchestrates independent upstream projects. This file explains their v0.1.0 packaging relationships and also retains research projects that are not release dependencies. [`engines/catalog.json`](engines/catalog.json) is authoritative for the exact engine source, artifact digest, runnable state, blockers, and license disposition. The managed-runtime manifest is authoritative for platform-specific runtime files. This narrative cannot make a missing artifact runnable or prove that a GitHub Release or image was published.

The applicable terms are those attached to each exact source revision and distributed artifact, including its dependencies, images, plugins, rules, templates, feeds, and databases. Every release generates locked dependency notices, engine notices, managed-runtime component inventories, and SPDX/CycloneDX SBOMs from the resolved artifacts. Those generated files describe the bytes in that release; this source inventory is not a substitute for them or for legal advice.

The `ai-security-scanner` repository currently carries the Apache License 2.0 in the root `LICENSE` file. That license covers this project's own work only and does not replace, relicense, or override any third-party terms recorded here.

## Disposition labels

- `ALLOW`: the engineering release record marks the exact project-managed artifact for distribution with its required license texts, notices, and dependency obligations.
- `SOURCE_OFFER`: the release record identifies a project-managed copyleft artifact and its corresponding-source or source-offer path.
- `SOURCE_ARCHIVE`: a managed-runtime record binds a distributed copyleft binary to an exact corresponding-source archive URL, digest, and size.
- `UPSTREAM_PINNED`: the product retrieves an exact verified upstream artifact by digest and does not republish it as a project-managed engine image.
- `GENERATED_INVENTORY`: the resolved release graph, notices, and SBOM—not this row—enumerate the artifact-specific dependency terms.
- `NOT_DISTRIBUTED`: tracked or referenced source that is not shipped by the described v0.1.0 component.
- `MANUAL`: repository metadata did not provide an unambiguous SPDX identifier or the project has special terms requiring manual review.
- `RESEARCH`: tracked for evaluation; not a committed release dependency.
- `ARCHIVED`: upstream is archived and requires a maintenance/replacement decision.

`ALLOW`, `SOURCE_OFFER`, and `SOURCE_ARCHIVE` apply only to the exact recorded artifact and are engineering dispositions rather than legal advice. `UPSTREAM_PINNED` is not a blanket permission or a statement that the artifact is inside the desktop installer. `MANUAL`, `RESEARCH`, `ARCHIVED`, and `NOT_DISTRIBUTED` never imply release approval.

existing scanners; VibeScan itself is not a release dependency.

## Supporting standards and runtime inventory

The platform-specific managed-runtime manifest records every bundled file, first-setup download, source revision, license expression, size, and SHA-256. The release pipeline emits that manifest plus runtime notices and SPDX/CycloneDX SBOMs for Linux, macOS, and Windows. The relationships below summarize that generated evidence rather than claiming that every research repository is packaged.

| Component | Official source | Pinned license record | v0.1.0 relationship | Disposition |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| OCSF schema | [ocsf/ocsf-schema](https://github.com/ocsf/ocsf-schema) | Apache-2.0 | Versioned interchange reference implemented by project-owned export code; no upstream schema artifact is bundled | NOT_DISTRIBUTED |
| OSCAL | [usnistgov/OSCAL](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL) | NIST publication terms | Versioned exchange reference implemented by project-owned export code; no upstream repository artifact is bundled | NOT_DISTRIBUTED |
| Tauri and resolved desktop dependencies | [tauri-apps/tauri](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri) | Apache-2.0 OR MIT for Tauri; per-package terms in the resolved graph | Compiled desktop dependency; release notices and desktop SBOM enumerate the exact graph | GENERATED_INVENTORY |
| Podman machine client | [containers/podman](https://github.com/containers/podman) | Apache-2.0 | Exact platform client files bundled in the desktop managed-runtime resource | ALLOW |
| podman-machine-os | [containers/podman-machine-os](https://github.com/containers/podman-machine-os) | Apache-2.0 project; contained packages retain their own terms | Exact VM image downloaded on first managed-runtime setup by URL, size, and digest | UPSTREAM_PINNED |
| gvisor-tap-vsock | [containers/gvisor-tap-vsock](https://github.com/containers/gvisor-tap-vsock) | Apache-2.0 | Exact `gvproxy` and, on Windows, SSH proxy helpers bundled per platform | ALLOW |
| QEMU system emulator | [qemu-project/qemu](https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu) | GPL-2.0-only | Linux-only static system emulator built from a checksum-pinned source archive recorded in runtime evidence | SOURCE_ARCHIVE |
| Device Tree Compiler | [qemu-project/dtc](https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/dtc) | GPL-2.0-or-later AND BSD-2-Clause | Exact source incorporated into the Linux QEMU build; source archive URL and digest recorded | SOURCE_ARCHIVE |
| vfkit | [crc-org/vfkit](https://github.com/crc-org/vfkit) | Apache-2.0 | Exact macOS Apple Virtualization.framework helper bundled in the universal runtime | ALLOW |
| Moby | [moby/moby](https://github.com/moby/moby) | Apache-2.0 | Architecture research only; not used by the packaged managed runtime | NOT_DISTRIBUTED |
| Docker CLI and Compose | [docker/cli](https://github.com/docker/cli), [docker/compose](https://github.com/docker/compose) | Apache-2.0 | Optional user-installed compatibility provider; not bundled or required by the product | NOT_DISTRIBUTED |

## Redistributed framework reference data

| Component | Official source | Pinned license record | Relationship | Disposition |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| AIDEFEND selected actionable-control metadata | [edward-playground/aidefense-framework](https://github.com/edward-playground/aidefense-framework/tree/e10c1678ee49f03f8fb0c97d446ba3fbc3543655) | CC-BY-4.0 framework content at version `1.20260805`; source `data/data.json` SHA-256 `ee0db6542fe28bcb3bd9ead0fba0fb69884b6cb765f2a1a420ceaf119a472786` | Modified six-record metadata selection with pinned provenance, attribution, and full content-license text under [`mappings/vendor/aidefend/1.20260805/`](mappings/vendor/aidefend/1.20260805/) | ALLOW |

The selected AIDEFEND snapshot contains only control ID, name, tactic, parent,
pillar, phase, and upstream `contentHash` fields. It does not copy source code,
descriptions, implementation guidance, code examples, tool lists, keywords,
external-framework mapping strings, logos, badges, or other trademark assets.
AIDEFEND is used nominatively to identify the source. This is an independent,
unofficial integration and is not affiliated with, approved, certified,
sponsored, or endorsed by AIDEFEND or its owner. The selected coordinates are
navigation and classification metadata, not evidence of control
implementation, effectiveness, certification, or compliance.

## Docker Desktop is separate

[Docker Desktop licensing](https://docs.docker.com/subscription/desktop-license/) is not the same as the Apache-2.0 licenses on Moby, Docker CLI, or Docker Compose. `ai-security-scanner` must not bundle, redistribute, or require an enterprise user to use Docker Desktop based only on those repository licenses.

The v0.1.0 packaged path uses a private, versioned Podman machine runtime: QEMU on Linux, Apple Virtualization.framework through vfkit on macOS, and an existing WSL 2 capability on Windows. Docker or a user-installed Podman remains an optional compatibility provider and is never treated as part of the installer.

## Rules, feeds, plugins, and databases

Rules, feeds, plugins, and databases remain independently identified artifacts even when they share an engine image. The desktop installers contain none of them. The separately published v0.1.0 engine artifacts use only the exact data closure recorded by their plans and catalog:

- CloudQuery and Steampipe carry only their pinned provider/plugin closure; Powerpipe and other compliance mods are not shipped.
- Nuclei carries one exact allowlisted template snapshot; private, live, destructive, and out-of-band template packs are not shipped or automatically enabled.
- Greenbone carries one digest-pinned Community Feed snapshot, executable NASL source, data, declared license texts, revision, checksum manifest, and upstream detached signature; it performs no live feed synchronization.
- Trivy and Grype each carry one immutable offline vulnerability database with its digest, timestamp, and attribution notice; automatic database updates are disabled.
- Semgrep carries a small project-owned offline rule file; no registry rules, Pro component, or token-driven installer is included.
- Gitleaks is built from the pinned 8.30.1 source under its MIT license and paired with a project-owned Apache-2.0 non-shell launcher. The launcher performs a current-worktree directory scan using only the scanner-owned configuration, ignores repository `.gitleaksignore` and `gitleaks:allow` suppressions, treats findings as results with `--exit-code 0`, and requires 100% secret redaction before output becomes evidence. The workspace is read-only and engine networking is disabled.
- Checkov's packaged policies, the KICS upstream-image query pack, Kubescape's three checksum-pinned offline policy assets, and kube-bench's benchmark configuration stay bound to their exact engine artifacts.

No statement above claims that a newer feed, database, policy, plugin, user-supplied pack, or language advisory index is shipped. Replacing any one requires a new source, terms, version/date, digest, update method, disposition, evidence set, and support window. An engine's source license does not automatically license its data.

## General obligations by license family

This section is an engineering checklist, not legal advice.

### Permissive licenses

MIT, BSD-3-Clause, and Apache-2.0 generally permit redistribution with preservation of copyright, license, attribution, and applicable NOTICE material. Apache-2.0 also contains patent and NOTICE provisions. Dependency licenses still apply.

### CC0

CC0-1.0 is a public-domain dedication/fallback license. Retaining provenance and the upstream license text is still project policy.

### MPL-2.0

MPL-2.0 has file-level source obligations for covered files and modifications. A distributed binary or image requires a corresponding-source path and required notices for covered code.

### LGPL-2.1

LGPL obligations depend on whether the project links, modifies, or merely distributes a separate executable. Distribution still requires the license and applicable source/relinking obligations. The release review must examine the actual wrapper and artifact, not rely on the words “separate process.”

### GPL-2.0 and GPL-3.0

Distribution requires the applicable GPL materials, complete corresponding source or a compliant source offer, notices, and license-compatible treatment of modifications. Packaging multiple programs as an aggregate does not remove obligations for the GPL programs.

### AGPL-3.0

AGPL includes GPL distribution obligations and a network-interaction source provision for modified covered software used over a network. Running an AGPL component locally or in a separate container is not a blanket exception. Each actual integration and modification must be reviewed.

### NOASSERTION and special terms

`NOASSERTION` means the automated repository metadata was not sufficient. It does not mean no license or unrestricted use. These components remain non-redistributable until a human reviews the pinned revision and records a decision.

## Release compliance requirements

The release workflow enforces the mechanical evidence requirements below. They support license compliance work but do not replace qualified legal analysis:

1. Resolve every included artifact to a source revision, version, and digest.
2. Generate an SBOM for the desktop application, broker, runtime, images, adapters, and bundled data.
3. Re-evaluate licenses from the pinned artifacts rather than copying this narrative unchanged.
4. Produce required license texts, attribution, NOTICE files, corresponding source, patches, and source offers.
5. Verify trademarks and naming restrictions separately from copyright licenses.
6. Confirm whether each artifact is bundled, built by the project, or downloaded on demand.
7. Confirm that on-demand download terms allow the proposed use; downloading later is not a license bypass.
8. Record the decision in the engine catalog, plan, generated notices, and release evidence.
9. Reject a Required engine from a stable release when its catalog entry is non-runnable, blocked, lacks an immutable artifact digest, or lacks an `allow`/`source_offer` disposition.

This file must be updated whenever a required engine, runtime component, ruleset, feed, database, plugin, or license changes.
