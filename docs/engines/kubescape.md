# Kubescape

Runs Kubescape's NSA framework (`scan framework nsa`) offline over an immutable snapshot of local Kubernetes YAML or JSON manifests attached to a `kubernetes_cluster` asset (input profile `kubernetes_manifests`). No live cluster is contacted; the framework, control inputs and exceptions are embedded in the image.

## Local build and update entry

Build from the repository root with [this Dockerfile](../../engines/images/kubescape/Dockerfile) and context `.`.

No host `.engine-cache` preparation is required by this Dockerfile. Acquisition and any source preparation happen in the build; this does not imply the build is offline.

See the [image build index](image-build-index.md) for the repeatable local build command, shared launcher impact and update record. The sections below retain this engine’s specific patches, output fields, tests and incident history.

## How it is wired

- **Input.** "Kubernetes configuration" in `src/localInputProfiles.ts`: a folder of exported YAML or JSON settings, which the form says must not contain kubeconfig files, tokens or certificates. `validate_copied_input_files` in `src-tauri/src/workspace_snapshot.rs` requires at least one `.json`, `.yaml` or `.yml` file, the snapshot carries the marker `.ai-security-scanner-input.json` with `input_profile` `kubernetes_manifests`, and `expected_input_profile` in `src-tauri/src/registry.rs` binds `kubernetes_cluster` to that profile. `localInputEngineIds` routes the profile to Kubescape, and without explicit routes the backend default plan (`default_plan_includes_manifest` in `src-tauri/src/case_service.rs`) includes it whenever an authorized asset carries such a snapshot; the catalog `default_enabled` (true) is not read by the planner.
- **Network and resources.** Engine networking disabled. Catalog `execution.resources`: 2048 MB memory, 2048 MB disk, 2000 CPU millis, 256 pids, 3600 s. Read-only root filesystem and `/workspace`, all capabilities dropped (`src-tauri/src/container_runtime.rs`).
- **Invocation.** The launcher accepts only `--engine kubescape --workspace /workspace --output /output`, refuses a writable workspace, allows Kubescape only with the `kubernetes_manifests` marker, and checks `nsa.json`, `controls-inputs.json` and `exceptions.json` in `/opt/ai-security-scanner/kubescape-artifacts/` against `kubescapeNSASHA256`, `kubescapeControlsSHA256` and `kubescapeExceptionsSHA256` (each at most 4 MiB). Then, with a fixed environment plus `KS_SUBMIT=false OTEL_SDK_DISABLED=true` and a 1 h timeout: `kubescape scan framework nsa /workspace --use-from <artifacts>/nsa.json --controls-config <artifacts>/controls-inputs.json --exceptions <artifacts>/exceptions.json --keep-local --submit=false --host-scan=false --omit-raw-resources --format json --format-version v2 --scan-timeout 45m --control-timeout 2m --output /output/kubescape.json`.
- **Output.** `/output/kubescape.json`. `validateEvidence` requires one JSON value of at most 512 MiB with nothing after it; the file is then set to 0600. Diagnostics are capped at 8 MiB. Only JSON is produced, although the catalog `output_formats` also lists `sarif`.
- **Mapping.** `extract_kubescape` walks `results[]` (location `resourceID`, else `resource`, else `kubernetes-resource`) and each entry's `controls[]`.
  - Status is the v2 object `status.status`, or a plain `status` string from older shapes; only a failing status becomes a finding.
  - Rule id `controlID`; title is the control `name`, else the `summaryDetails.controls` name. References come from the control's `rules`.
  - Severity is the roll-up's 1-10 `scoreFactor` from `summaryDetails.controls.<id>` through `parse_severity` (9 and above Critical, 7 High, 4 Medium, above 0 Low), else Unknown. Confidence basis `DeterministicPolicyEvaluation`, evidence kind Configuration.
  - Only when `results` yields no finding do failing `summaryDetails.controls` entries become findings, located at `kubernetes-cluster`.
- **Failed, partial, not tested.** A wrong marker (reported as `local_input_profile_unsupported`), an artifact hash mismatch, a non-zero Kubescape exit, the timeout, log overflow or invalid JSON makes the container exit 126, and `src-tauri/src/orchestrator.rs` fails the run without adapting. The run is partial when the document is not a JSON object ("Kubescape expected a JSON document") or the 10,000-record bound is reached. A document with neither `results` nor `summaryDetails` reads as zero findings without a warning, and a failing control without `controlID` is skipped silently.

## Downstream changes

- No source patches: `go.sum` is hash-checked, then `go mod verify` and `go build -mod=readonly`. The ldflags stamp `main.version=v4.0.12`, `main.commit` and `main.date`.
- Offline operation is upstream flags only: `--use-from`, `--controls-config`, `--exceptions`, `--keep-local`, `--submit=false` and `--host-scan=false`, plus `KS_SUBMIT=false` and `OTEL_SDK_DISABLED=true` in both the image `ENV` and the launcher environment.
- The NSA framework, control inputs and exceptions come from `https://github.com/kubescape/regolibrary/releases/download/v2/{nsa,default_config_inputs,exceptions}` with `ADD --checksum`. The same three hashes are in the launcher constants and `ARTIFACT-NOTICE.md`, which ships in the image.

## Lessons from real runs

- 2026-09-05: on v2 output every per-resource control fell back to the summary roll-up, one finding per control with no resource -> the adapter read a flat string `status`, and the fixture had been invented to match the code -> nested `status.status`, `scoreFactor` severity, `resourceID` location, a fixture in the v2 shape and mutation tests (696183c).
- 2026-09-11: a real all-engine run reported Kubescape `C-0009` and `C-0017` with no framework coordinate -> only one representative rule had been mapped -> both mapped (5128304).
- 2026-09-17: the local/k8s publish job failed for Kubescape with "version tag is already bound to a different source commit or workflow" although its inputs had not changed -> the guard bound a tag to the commit that first published it -> it now compares the plan's recorded input hashes (415ab1b).

## Updating this engine

Follow [section 4](../engine-maintenance.md#4-updating-an-engine), then:

- **Next publish needs a new tag.** The pinned `4.0.12-3` was published from 2641850 (plan `publication`) with a launcher whose `main.go` hashes to `8ae5ab14…`. The plan's `wrapper.launcher_sha256` was re-pointed to `e5b1c32b…` by ef1c653, 0e4dd55, f6b6171 and 686e427 without a rebuild, and `plan.json` at 2641850 still binds `4.0.12-2`. `publicationPreflight` in `scripts/engine-image-evidence.mjs` therefore refuses `4.0.12-3` on the next run of the matrix entry; move to a new tag in the same change. The Kubescape invocation, marker rule and artifact checks are identical in both launchers, so the pinned image behaves like the current source.
- **Source.** Change the archive URL and `ADD --checksum`, the `go.sum` hash, the ldflags, the `org.opencontainers.image.revision` label, the plan `source` and `build_recipe`, and the catalog `source_revision`, `engine_version`, `provenance`. `engines/upstreams.lock.json` records a different research checkout (`fdd64f43…` on `master`), not the image pin.
- **Rule artifacts.** The `v2` release assets can be replaced upstream; a changed file fails `ADD --checksum`. To move, re-hash all three files and update the Dockerfile, the three launcher constants, `ARTIFACT-NOTICE.md` (tag object and commit), the `io.ai-security-scanner.regolibrary-revision` label, catalog `rule_version` and `provenance.rules.revision`.
- **Output shape.** Re-check the v2 report: `results[].resourceID`, `results[].controls[].controlID`, `name`, `status.status`, `rules`, and `summaryDetails.controls.<id>.name`, `scoreFactor` and `status`. Re-check that every flag in the invocation still exists.
- **Tests.** Fixture `src-tauri/tests/fixtures/adapters/kubescape.json` (two resources, three failing and one passing control). `kubescape_per_resource_results_are_read_not_only_the_summary_rollup` expects `c-0002` Medium, `c-0009` High, `c-0017` Low and exactly three findings; `fingerprints_are_stable_across_repeat_runs` also uses it. Launcher test `TestKubescapeIsOfflineManifestOnly`. The fixture is hand-made in the v2 shape; prefer replacing it with a real run of the new image.
- **Mapping.** `mappings/control-mappings.json` maps `C-0002`, `C-0009` and `C-0017`. Kubescape ids have no shape check in `engine_rule_identifiers_have_the_shape_their_engine_actually_emits`, so check each against `nsa.json` and a real run. A content change needs a `mapping_version` bump.
- **Hard-coded tag.** `4.0.12-3` is in `engines/catalog.json`, `plan.json`, the Dockerfile version label, the workflow matrix, `scripts/validate-engine-catalog.mjs`, `scripts/release/verify-publication-artifact.mjs` and `tests/release/verifyPublicationArtifact.test.mjs`; `4.0.12` is also the workflow `version`, the ldflag and the catalog `engine_version`. Check with `grep -rn "4.0.12-3" --exclude-dir=node_modules --exclude-dir=target --exclude-dir=.git --exclude-dir=.upstreams`. `support_until` is 2026-11-22.
- **Publishing.** `ARTIFACT-NOTICE.md` is copied into the image but, like every `.md` file, has no digest in `plan.json` (`engines/image-input-hash-policy.json`), so the publication guard would reuse the old image after a notice-only change; advance the tag by hand. A shared-launcher change moves `wrapper.launcher_sha256` in all six local plans. The workflow smoke runs the managed scan over `testdata/` (a privileged pod) but checks only the version string and that `kubescape.json` parses.
- **Compare with raw output.** In the raw `kubescape.json`, every `results[].controls[]` entry with `status.status` `failed` should be one finding at its `resourceID`, with the severity its `summaryDetails.controls.<id>.scoreFactor` implies. Findings located at `kubernetes-cluster` mean the per-resource results were not read.
