# Checkov

Runs Checkov's bundled policy checks over a `repository` or `iac_project` snapshot. Checkov picks the applicable frameworks, such as Terraform, CloudFormation and Dockerfile, from the files present. Only failed checks are reported, and no platform metadata is downloaded.

| Upstream | [bridgecrewio/checkov](https://github.com/bridgecrewio/checkov) 3.3.13 (`source_ref` `3.3.13`), revision `0604e97b0f77c89a8c6c1fe2219c3d251cbb9789`. The upstream image `bridgecrew/checkov:3.3.13` (`c5fb7154…`) was rejected: its provenance names revision `e5745d49…` (`attested_mismatch`), and it enters through `/entrypoint.sh`. |
| Image | `ghcr.io/teddashh/ai-security-scanner-engine-checkov:3.3.13-1` (`plan_kind: managed_source_image`, Apache-2.0), published from 122f3c2 (run 32754480450). The digest is pinned in `engines/catalog.json`. |
| Build inputs | `engines/images/checkov/`: `Dockerfile`, `prepare_source.py`, `.dockerignore` (lets only those two into the context) and `plan.json`. `prepare_source.py` checks the source archive and `Pipfile.lock` digests, extracts the archive with path checks, and renders the 99 `default` records into a hashed requirements lock. pip installs that lock with `--require-hashes --only-binary=:all:`, then Checkov itself with `--no-deps`; the build asserts `checkov --version` is `3.3.13`. Both stages use `python:3.11.16-slim` by digest. |
| Launcher | None: `ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/local/bin/checkov"]` receives the catalog `command`. The [local launcher](local-launcher.md) is not used. |
| Adapter | `extract_checkov` and `extract_checkov_framework` in `src-tauri/src/adapters/mod.rs` |
| Publish workflow | `.github/workflows/engine-image-checkov.yml`, triggered by the `Dockerfile`, `prepare_source.py` or `.dockerignore` |

## Local build and update entry

Build from the repository root with [this Dockerfile](../../engines/images/checkov/Dockerfile) and context `engines/images/checkov`.

No host `.engine-cache` preparation is required by this Dockerfile. Acquisition and any source preparation happen in the build; this does not imply the build is offline.

See the [image build index](image-build-index.md) for the repeatable local build command, shared launcher impact and update record. The sections below retain this engine’s specific patches, output fields, tests and incident history.

## How it is wired

- **Input.** One asset: a `repository` (`repository_working_tree`) or an `iac_project` (`iac_working_tree`). Networking is disabled. Catalog resources: 2048 MB memory, 2048 MB disk, 2000 CPU millis, 3600 s.
- **Invocation.** `checkov -d /workspace --framework all --output json --output-file-path /output/checkov.json, --skip-download --quiet --soft-fail`.
  - The trailing comma is required. With a comma, upstream `print_reports` (`checkov/common/runners/runner_registry.py`) reads the value as one file per output format; without it, the value is a directory and the file is named `results_json.json`.
  - `--skip-download` keeps platform metadata out, so severities and guidelines are mostly absent (b42ad87). `--quiet` limits the JSON to failed checks. With `--soft-fail`, failed checks do not cause a non-zero exit.
  - The image sets `BC_ENABLE_PERSIST_GRAPHS=false`, the three `CKV_*_CONFIG_FETCH_DATA=false` switches, `CKV_SKIP_PACKAGE_UPDATE_CHECK=true` and `RUN_IN_DOCKER=true`, with `HOME` and `XDG_CACHE_HOME` under `/tmp`.
  - `scripts/validate-engine-catalog.mjs` requires the graph, fetch and update-check switches, `--framework all` and `--skip-download`, and rejects `--compact`.
- **Output.** `/output/checkov.json` holds one report object for a single framework, an array of report objects for several, or only the summary when no framework applied. Without `--compact`, each failed check keeps its `code_block` (the resource's source lines) in the raw artifact; the adapter never reads it.
- **Mapping.** One record per `results.failed_checks[]` item:
  - Rule id `check_id` (exact). Title `check_name`, else `Checkov check <id>`. Description `description` or `short_description`.
  - Severity: Checkov's `severity` when present, else Unknown with basis `IacPolicyCheck`. b42ad87 found one shipped check that rates itself offline, `CKV2_AWS_34`. Confidence is derived (`DeterministicPolicyEvaluation`).
  - Location `<file_path or repo_file_path>:line=<first line>:resource=<resource or resource_address>`. Links come from `references_from` (`guideline`) plus the manifest URLs.
- **Failed or partial.** A non-zero exit fails the run. These make it partial, keeping valid rows:
  - a root that is neither an object nor an array;
  - a framework report that is not an object, or that has no `results` and is not the summary-only document;
  - `results` that is not an object, or `failed_checks` that is not an array;
  - a failed check that is not an object or has no valid `check_id`;
  - 10,000 failed checks or framework reports.

  The adapter does not read `summary`. Files Checkov could not parse (`summary.parsing_errors`) and checks skipped by `checkov:skip=` comments in the scanned files (`COMMENT_REGEX` in upstream `checkov/common/comment/enum.py`; quiet JSON keeps only `summary.skipped`) leave the run complete.

## Downstream changes

- **No source patches.** Checkov is built unmodified from the pinned source archive.
- **Source build instead of the upstream image.** The plan rejects the published image (`rejected_because_build_inputs_and_entrypoint_are_not_release_safe`). Re-inspect the upstream image at each update; return to it only if its provenance names the release revision and its entrypoint is the binary.

## Lessons from real runs

- 2026-09-05: unrated findings carried `source-severity:unknown`, a rating Checkov never gave, and sorted below Low -> `BaseCheck` sets `severity` to `None`, `--skip-download` keeps the platform ratings out, and the adapter turned a null into the literal `unknown` -> an explicit Checkov rating wins, and a missing one is derived. The derived level was Medium until 97093ae made it Unknown. The invented fixture was replaced by a real quiet-mode document (b42ad87).
- 2026-09-27: a real project report printed "Dockerfile · line 1 · /Dockerfile." -> Checkov names a Dockerfile resource after the file -> the report drops a resource label that repeats the path, and `/app/Dockerfile.EXPOSE` reads as `EXPOSE` (d53ca4e).

## Updating this engine

Follow [section 4](../engine-maintenance.md#4-updating-an-engine), then:

- **Build.** Update in step:
  - the archive URL and `ADD --checksum`;
  - `prepare_source.py`: `SOURCE_REVISION`, `SOURCE_ARCHIVE_SHA256`, `PIPFILE_LOCK_SHA256`, `EXPECTED_DEPENDENCIES` (the `default` record count), `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` and the header comment;
  - the Dockerfile `--version` assertion, the labels and every `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` value;
  - the plan `source`, `verified_upstream_artifact` (re-inspect), `build_recipe` and `dockerfile.sha256`;
  - the catalog `engine_version`, `source_revision`, `rule_version`, provenance and the notice that counts 99 records.

  Every dependency needs a wheel for amd64 and arm64. `rendered_requirements_sha256` is only format-checked; compare it with the SHA-256 of `/usr/share/licenses/checkov/runtime-requirements.lock` in the built image. `validateManagedSourceImage` in the validator checks the Dockerfile's frontend, `FROM` lines, source URL and checksum, hash-mode flags, `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`, preparer copy, lock digest, user, entrypoint and environment against the plan.
- **CLI and output shape.** Re-check the comma rule in `print_reports`, the four flags, and the quiet `get_dict` shape (`check_type`, `results.failed_checks`, `summary`) and summary-only document. Re-check `check_id`, `check_name`, `file_path`, `repo_file_path`, `file_line_range`, `resource`, `severity`, `guideline`, `description` and `short_description`. Re-count the checks that declare a severity locally.
- **Mapping.** `mappings/control-mappings.json` has one exact entry, `CKV_AWS_18`; confirm the id still exists. The adapter reads no CWE.
- **Tests.**
  - In `src-tauri/tests/adapter_fixtures.rs` (fixture `checkov.json`): `checkov_all_framework_output_preserves_each_finding_and_its_exact_pointer`, `checkov_all_framework_output_contains_malformed_rows_without_losing_valid_findings`, `checkov_preserves_explicit_ratings_and_keeps_missing_ones_unknown` and `source_coordinates_prevent_distinct_upstream_results_from_being_silently_merged`.
  - The fixture still nulls `code_block` as `--compact` output would, and no test covers the summary-only document.
  - The workflow never runs the image. Before pinning, scan a repository holding Terraform, CloudFormation and a Dockerfile, and check that `checkov.json` appears with rows from each framework.
- **Hard-coded values.** `3.3.13-1` appears in the workflow `concurrency.group` and `IMAGE_TAG`, catalog `image.tag` and plan `final_artifact.tag`. `3.3.13` also appears in the Dockerfile assertion and label, `prepare_source.py`, the catalog `engine_version`, provenance and notice, plan `verified_upstream_artifact.tag`, and the fixture's `checkov_version`. Find them with `grep -rn "3.3.13" --exclude-dir=node_modules --exclude-dir=target --exclude-dir=.git --exclude-dir=.upstreams --exclude-dir=.engine-cache`. `support_until` is 2026-11-22.
- **Compare with raw output.**
  - Count with `jq '[(if type=="array" then .[] else . end) | .results.failed_checks[]?] | length' checkov.json`.
  - List with `jq -r '(if type=="array" then .[] else . end) | .results.failed_checks[]? | [.check_id, .file_path, .file_line_range[0], .resource] | @tsv' checkov.json | sort | uniq -c`; identical rows merge into one finding.
  - Read `jq '(if type=="array" then .[] else . end) | (.summary // .) | {failed, skipped, parsing_errors}' checkov.json` for what the report does not show.
- **Publishing.** The plan holds two records with the same platform digests: `publication` (run 32754480450, source 122f3c2) and `publication_evidence` (run 32713536164, source 8bdeb311, which is not in this repository's history). The plan at 122f3c2 binds `3.3.13-1` with today's input digests. Its command differs (`--framework terraform` and `--compact`, changed by ef1c653 and 0e4dd55), but the command is not built into the image. Any change to a watched file needs a new tag.
