/**
 * Writes the sentences this product says about a finding, in the reader's
 * language.
 *
 * The backend composes the same three sentences in English and stores them on
 * the finding. That happens before any locale is known and the result is frozen
 * into the case, so a zh-TW reader was shown 可能影響 above "If the scanner
 * result is confirmed, ..." — a translated heading over an English paragraph,
 * on the three fields that carry the entire meaning of a finding.
 *
 * Every input the backend composed from is a closed set, so this side can write
 * the same sentence rather than translate the finished one. Two consequences
 * are deliberate:
 *
 *  - English and Chinese are composed from the same structured fields. Legacy
 *    stored prose is normalized so an older case follows the current report
 *    contract too.
 *  - A finding with no code — stored before the codes were carried, or produced
 *    by a build that knows a family this one does not — falls back to that same
 *    English prose. Untranslated is worse than translated and better than blank.
 *
 * The engine's own `title` is not covered. That is the engine's wording; saying
 * it back in another language would be this product speaking for it.
